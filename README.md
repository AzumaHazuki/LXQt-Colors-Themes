# LXQt-Colors-Themes
This repository houses LXQt ports of the old Shiki-Colors/LX-Colors-Revival themes, as well as matching palettes and Openbox styles (extract the archive directly into your themes directory).

Below is a screenshot of LXQt-Brave; as the themes differ mainly in accent colors, uploading a screen capture for each would be somewhat redundant.
